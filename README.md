# U-120M proton beam model in PHITS
Monte Carlo model (PHITS) of proton beam output of cyclotron U-120M in Řež, Czechia. Experimental setup: 
- 33 MeV proton beam
- beam divergence of +/- 1.2339 degrees
- 0.86 mm thick Ta foil 40 cm from nozzle
- Si detection element of minipix TPX3 detector 10 cm perpendicularly to the beam, 10 cm parallel to the foil and angled at 45 degrees.

T-Track tally is used to visualized the setup and beam geometry.
